review_p_2 = Just arrived from Kazakhstan. We rested in Borovoye. Astana is 2.5 hours away on the highway, more precisely - 300 km from Borovoe. It was an interesting trip. Astana is divided into two cities - the old and the new city. The new city is only 13 years old and has not yet grown up in history, but every architectural structure deserves attention and admiration. The first impression is the elegant roads, even, wide, with LED illumination of pedestrian crossings on the roads, ie, directly in the asphalt. In general, they have no trouble with roads!
