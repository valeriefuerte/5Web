review_p_1 = Rayon Starogo Goroda (Gamla Stan) imeyet chetko ocherchennyye granitsy, poskol'ku raspolozhen na otdel'nom ostrove. Zastroyka rayona nachalas' yeshche v 13 veke, poetomu zdes' mnogo uzkikh moshchonykh ulochek, malen'kikh uyutnykh ploshchadey i nebol'shikh, prizhavshikhsya drug k drugu zheltykh domikov, vystroyennykh v stile severo-germanskoy gotiki. The area of the Old City (Gamla Stan) has clearly delineated boundaries, as it is located on a separate island. The construction of the district began in the 13th century, so there are many narrow cobblestone streets, small cozy squares and small yellow houses crouching to each other, built in the style of the North German Gothic style.
